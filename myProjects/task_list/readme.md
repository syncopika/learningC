this is supposed to be a sort of checklist-type program that has an underlying min-heap 
to keep the order of various activities inputted by the user based on priority number.    
     
I'm using the Win32 API to create the GUI.    

You can add events with their priority number and retrieve the nextmost important event, so far.    
    
anyway, for completeness, I would like to touch up the UI if possible and maybe make the read-only text window clearable. 
    
currently it looks like this:  
<img src='testgui.png'></img>
